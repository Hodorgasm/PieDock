PieDock is a task bar and application launcher in shape of a pie menu.
It feels a little bit like the famous OS X dock in a circle.

Manual configure, compile and install:

	$ ./configure

Alternatively, for Gnome integration, run configure with:

	$ ./configure --enable-gtk

Or for KDE use:

	$ ./configure --enable-kde

To compile:

	$ make

Then as root:

	# make install-strip

Finally, you may want to invoke the setup script with normal privileges:

	$ sh/setup
	
Or manually copy res/piedockrc.sample to ~/.piedockrc and modify it to
meet your needs.
